<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in
  Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family
  inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
  Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous
  Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their
  company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
  Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes
  prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also
  considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
  leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

    <h3>Thorin II Oakenshield</h3>
    <p>
      Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the
      Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the
      Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While
      in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was
      demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799.
      He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria.
      At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree
      branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet
      "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

    <h3>Fíli & Kíli</h3>
    <p>
      Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their
      mother Dís. They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and
      great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long
      nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

    <h3>Óin</h3>
    <p>
      Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle
      of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin. He
      usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the
      Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined
      with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain
      wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo
      would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his
      brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company
      as they were the most skilled out of the others. He fought in and survived
      the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with
      King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of The Company of
      Thorin.

    <h3>Glóin</h3>
    <p>
      Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was
      the younger child of Gróin and younger brother of Óin. <br />In TA 2799,
      Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last
      battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how
      significant his contribution was, being 16 years old. <br />In TA 2879, in
      the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an
      unknown wife. In March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by
      chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so
      that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits,
      Glóin referred them as "simpletons" and also said that Hobbits "would
      never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new
      from the shell".

    <h3>Balin</h3>
    <p>
      Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the
      dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those
      driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain.
      Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in
      the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of
      Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied
      Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the
      Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

    <h3>Dwalín</h3>
    <p>
      Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor,
      Dwalin was the son of Fundin and younger brother of Balin. After fighting
      in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thráin
      II and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.
